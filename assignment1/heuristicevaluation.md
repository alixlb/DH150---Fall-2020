# Competitive Analysis & Heuristic Evaluation

## Competitors Choosen for the Evaluation: 

The first step of the project was to look at websites focused on the same subject as this project,fitness, and see how they pass the Nielson's 10 Heuristic evaluation. Because of my topic and my audience, I choose to evaluate the website of the YMCA for online exercise classes, [YMCA 360](https://ymca360.org/on-demand), that sources videos from their gyms across the country and tries to meet the needs of all age groups. I also choose the app, [Yoga For Beginners](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/yoga-for-beginners-mind-body/id1382141225), that offers free yoga courses as well as detailed explanations of each pose. 

I choose these two as one is a website and one is an app so I can compare the differences in how each work and the pros and cons. As well, both are targeted for all age groups with levels of intensity that differ, which would allow middle-age women to find a choose a course that fit their needs. 

### YMCA 360
The YMCA 360 is an app that was put in place during COVID-19 by the YMCA gyms around the U.S. to allow users of their gyms to still get the workout classes at all times at home. On top of the online free pre-recorded classes which I focus my evaluation on, you could also get live small group and one on one coaching all virtual as well.
