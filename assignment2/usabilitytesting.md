# Usability Testing 

## Introduction 

![YMCA 360 - Ad](./y360ad.jpg)

My goal with this UX project is to create a website that easy to use and encourages everyone but especially middle-age women to find the right exercise classes for their needs depending on multiple variables such as intensity, location, duration etc. Because of the age demographic, I found that the YMCA was my closest competitor as it focuses more on exercises for all ages than other gyms that offer more of the high-intensity workouts younger demographics crave. The YMCA launched a website during the pandemic, [YMCA 360](https://ymca360.org/), that offers online recording of classes for free to all. 

After conducting a [heuristic evaluation](https://github.com/alixlb/DH150---Fall-2020/blob/main/assignment1/heuristicevaluation.md) on it, I realized multiple principles were being violated especially: help and documentation, user control and  freedom, and flexibility and efficiency of use. It was also hard sometimes to navigate through especially when trying to go back or find the favorite folder which is essential to the principle of recognition rather than recall. Hence I decided to look further into this website and see how my target audience reacts when using it to perform simple tasks. 

I started by a pilot Usability Test and focused on 3 main tasks: 
* playing a workout video
* finding the FAQ (frequently asked questions)
* using the favoring video function
I thought the most important part of this test was using a middle-age woman as my subject to see how she would react to the site. My goal with this experiment was to see if my Usability Test material was effective and in term better understand the usability experience of target users to then utilise those finding on my website. 

## Methodology 

I will perform this pilot usability test in my quiet living room at home. I will use Zoom on a MacBook Air to record the participant screen, their facial expressions, and audio. The pilot test is in order to test the setting and the UT materials. It should take  about 20 minutes to do.  I will be as well sitting next to them and taking notes as they go while being as unbiased of a moderator as can be. 

At the beginning of the test, I will explain the measures and rules of the usability testing to the participant. I will ask if I can record them and walk them through the steps of the test as follow:
* ***Background questions*** that are intended to see the participant possible history using this website.
* ***Pre-test questions*** that allow the participant to look at a screenshot of the website and judge the website on 4 criteria: straightforwardness, trustability, professionalism and how enticing it looks. At this point in the survey, the user is basing their judgment solely on the looks of the website. 
* ***Task 1*** revolves around being on the home page and making your way through the pages to play a workout video.
* ***Task 2*** involves going to the FAQ page and finding the answer to a question.
* ***Task 3*** consists of logging in, choosing to favor a video, and playing it. 
* ***Post-test questions*** helps get feedback about how the user perceive those tasks based on difficulty, relevancy and time spent.
* ***System Usability Scale*** judges how the participant felt using the website based on a scale of strongly disagree to strongly agree about the ease of use, efficiency etc.  
* ***Product satisfaction cards*** helps understand how the user perceives the website based on 5 adjectives to describe it.
* ***Demographic questions***: Questions about age, gender, ethnicity, primary language and how often they exercise.

 verall, the goal of this test is to get a holistic view of how the user feels using the website and get a better understanding about how the target demographic uses sites for fitness in general. 

## User Testing Material
To do the Usability Testing, I used:
* Macbook Air
* Zoom to record screen, audio and facial expressions. 
* Google Form to gather all the participants responses (view form [here](https://forms.gle/uxLMg5HAhpXMSHAq8))

## Reflection 

### What I Learn from the UT
This pilot usability testing aided me to fully understand the point of view of my target audience as well as validate some of my previous assumptions I made after the heuristic evaluation. I saw that the participant had no issues with finding a workout video and playing it but she did struggle with finding the FAQ and the favorite video folder. Thru this interview, I realized how much the website had been optimized for simple task of playing working out videos for free at all times and did it perfectly but then lacked the ability to help people perform the other tasks surrounding it. 

It was also very interesting to be a moderator for the first time as I realised how important it was not to say too much to the participant to influence their perspective. Even how I formulated questions had an impact on how they would respond to a certain question. Taking all of that into consideration, I tried to be a more silent moderator. I would simply guide the participant throught the pages but would not say much more. 

I think that overall the pilot test went well and will be able to be counted in my data later on. From it, I realized ho much when creating a website for fitness and not only needed to focus on creating an efficent user experience to access the workout videos but also a great experience for other other on it such as finding the FAQ, login in, favoring a video etc. 

### What Went Well and What Didn't

Overall the test went according to plan. The setting worked perfectly with no distractions and the Zoom setting up was easy for the participant to use and simple to then download. All the tasks were simple enough that the participant understood them and felt they were relevant to her when using a website like this but yet highlighted some flaws in the website when she struggled to do them.  

What didn't work was some simple spelling errors on the google form. I also had one question where by accident I had left an *option 10* which confused the participant about what it meant and forced me as a moderator to intervene and say it was an error. Additionally, on the pre-survey questions, I made the answers confusing as the first scale *very easy* was on the left while *very difficult* was on the right but for the 3 following ones *completely* was on the right and *not at all on the left*. ALs in my first task, I ask the participant to play the video. The participant did but then assumed she had to watch the whole video. I should have said watch the video for 15 seconds for instance. Overall all of these small errors did not cause her any major problems and create bias in the test but changing them for next time will be important. 

### How to Improve my Usability Testing in the Future
After the test, I already improved it by tweaking the couple of spelling errors and other wording that confused the participant. This will allow the UT next time to run more smoothly and avoid leading to potential confusing or bias questions. I also plan to be even less involved as a moderator and guide less the process in order to see even more their train of thoughts while they are perfroming the survey. All of these changes will allow the test to seem more professional and also natural to them as they wont feel as if I am guiding their moves and might feel more free and at home performing the tasks.
