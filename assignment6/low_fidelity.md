## Low Fidelity Prototype

### Overview
 * **User Research:** Over the course of the user-research done in the last 5 weeks, I have been able to find that the online fitness commnity lacks organizationa and a clear way to navigate through it. Since the start of the pandemic, a lot of gym have had to closed down and members have had to start working out at home leading to a large surge in need for online fitness without an easy way to navigate through all the options. My research has also shown that ux design wise most of the fitness site had a strong foundation. From conducting user interviews, I found that the experience of looking for a fitness class is overwhelming and takes too long, that friends opinion & social aspect of working out matter a lot, that too much information online & lack of filters makes the research frustrating at times, that price matters and that users look at pictures of the workout as a way to guage what the workout will be like. From all these key insights, I set out to draw users to better understand their feelings when going online to find a workout class as well as to find what features would be best to focus on and ameliorate during this project. 
 
 * **Personas:** During my research, I created 3 personas: June - the recent retiree, Mary - the social butterfly & Evalyn - the busy bee. I identified their needs, challenges and goals as well as created an empathy map to better understand how they felt during the process. I then used this new found understanding of my audience to create scenarios about how my key design features would help them solve any frustration they may have had during that process. I then created scenarios for that tested out how each feature could solve the frustration these personas were having. From this research, I gathered that easy to use and efficent pathways were very inportant as often times my users were either new to online fitness and needed a intuitive website to get to find a workout that works for them easily without giving up or feeling discouraged or were not novice but did not have the time to go looking through the entire internet for workouts and needed pathways that were quick and could narrow their choices accurately.
 
 * **Features:** 
 Based on my previous research, I plan to implement 3 design features that I believe will help users feel incentive to workout and more confident in their choices of workout:
    * Filters: create an extensive possibility of filter options and categorize them easily based on needs that users may have when working out. This will allow them to easily narrow down their choices from the thousands of options available to them on the internet. Some examples of those filters are: type of workout, level of intensity, lengths, targeted area of the body, equipment needed, type of workout (images, videos, prerecorded, live, in person, virtual), price, etc.
    * Social reviews: the ability to have an account on the site and interact with other of the site members through chats and trusted reviews. Like the Sephora website, the reviews will give some description of who the reviewer is in order to see what people similar to you have said about the particular workout and help you see if it may fit your needs. It creates a more social component that currently cannot be recreated due to the social distancing.
    * Quiz function: to help beginners or people with recent changes in their capabilities (injuries, pregnancies etc.) understand what are their needs and offer them initial options to see which they like and do not like.
    
 * **Purpose of low-fidelity prototype:** The purpose of this low-fidelity prototype is start planing the flow of my website as well as how each frame would look like in order to assure functionality for the users. My goal is to keep in mind my user-centric research and apply it to this low-fidelity prototype to ensure that it actually solved the user problem. I am then particularly excited to have a target audience member go through the wireframe and point out any areas that might be confusing. 

### The Tasks
For this wireframe, I will be testing out 4 tasks:
1. ***Take a quiz to find the right workout:*** The goal is to test out the flow of the quiz feature to make sure it makes sense. I did not include all the questions as that would be too many wire frames but I created at least one to ensure that the progression made sense. 
2. ***Use filters to find the workout you want:***. The goal is to test out the filter feature and to assure that is eleviating the stress of searching for a workout and making it quicker to narrow down the choices. I have only shown some of the criterias as it is only made to test functionality. 
3. ***Use reviews to get better understanding of the workout:***
4. ***Chat with people in your workout class:***

### Wireframe & Wireflow

The prototype: all the wireframes were handdrawn and then photographed and through Whimsical, I created the wireflow.

### Testing
After crafting the wireframe and performing a wirefont, I now had to see if it made sense to my target audience. I asked a person to test how they viewed the flow and what might be confusing about it.
