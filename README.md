## About this Project
This quarter's goal is to create a UX project that promotes well-being for middle age women. As we age, it is crucial to continue physical exercise on a daily basis to keep muscle mass and boost immune system and with the pandemic and people staying at home, it has been hard to be as active and work out. Being active is an essential part to well-being. It can often times be a pleasureful experience that helps feel happier overall and more concentrated and energetic.

However, online exercises classes are often either tailored to young adults and very fit individuals or on the opposite end of the spectrum elderly people and middle-age women sometimes feel left out of the equation. They are far more active and dynamic than elderly people but can also feel intimidated by intensive HIIT training targeted at a younger audience. Hence, my project would focus on a user-centric platform for fitness and well-being targeted at middle-age women. This platform will be easy to use and allow users to find all the fitnesses courses out there and see which ones are the best for them depending on variables such as time committment, prices, in-person or vitual, at home equipement or gym equipement, level of intensity etc. It will also create a community for my audience around the topics of fitness and well-being

### Community Contribution through this UX design

Through my UX design project, I hope to impact the lives of mid-age women (and potentially others) by offering an easy and seamless experience for people to find fitness programs/classes/exercises that fit into their schedule and help them stay in good health both physically and mentally. I also hope to incorporate a social aspect to this app to create a community around the topic of fitness habits. 

## Design Features 

Based on the research below, I decided to create 3 design features that I believe will help users feel incentive to workout and more confident in their choices of workout: 
* **Filters:** create an extensive possibility of filter options and categorize them easily based on needs that users may have when working out. This will allow them to  easily narrow down their choices from the thousands of options available to them on the internet. Some examples of those filters are: type of workout, level of intensity, lengths, targeted area of the body, equipment needed, type of workout (images, videos, prerecorded, live, in person, virtual), price, etc.
* **Social reviews:** the ability to have an account on the site and interact with other of the site members through chats and trusted reviews. Like the Sephora website, the reviews will give some description of who the reviewer is in order to see what people similar to you have said about the particular workout and help you see if it may fit your needs. It creates a more social component that currently cannot be recreated due to the social distancing. 
* **Quiz function:** to help beginners or people with recent changes in their capabilities (injuries, pregnancies etc.) understand what are their needs and offer them initial options to see which they like and do not like. 

## Competitive Analysis & Heuristic Evaluation

The first step of the project was to look at websites focused on the same subject as this project,fitness, and see how they pass the Nielson's 10 Heuristic evaluation. Because of my topic and my audience, I choose to evaluate the website of the YMCA for online exercise classes, [YMCA 360](https://ymca360.org/on-demand), that sources videos from their gyms across the country and tries to meet the needs of all age groups. I also choose the app, [Yoga For Beginners](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/yoga-for-beginners-mind-body/id1382141225), that offers free yoga courses as well as detailed explanations of each pose.

### Overall Findings

Overall, both the YMCA 360 and Yoga for Beginners are well design with a minimalistic theme and very enticing high resolution photos. Both are easy and intuitive to navigate through, making users instantly feel in control. However, both still have some serious heuristic violations that make part of the user experience confusing and uncomfortable which could potentially discourage them from reusing the site on a daily basis or even giving them an easy way out of working out. As the goal of my project is to promote healthy fitness habits from middle-age women by making it easy and enticing to them, I have marked a couple point that truly stood out during this evaluation:
* It is important not to use fitness jargon. Instead, to meet the criteria of heuristic principle 2, ***Match between system and real world***, titles and descriptions of workouts should focus more on the benefits they bring and how they may fulfill the needs the user may feel they have when it comes to working out (legs strengthen, destress, cardio, arm workout etc)
* Secondly the user needs to be in control, heuristic principle 3, ***User Control and freedom***. Especially during the workout, the user must be able to pause, play, rewind, slow down the video all while being able to leave easily. This will allow the user to not feel pressure to get the movement right on the spot or to not take any breaks. It is important that everyone be able to go at their own rhythm so they can have fun.
* Finally, it is crucial to have proper documentation and , heuristic principle 10 - ***Help and documentation***, contact forms to get feedback. Especially with first time or less tech-savvy users, it is crucial to have a clear help guide accessible from all pages to help them truly understand how the platform works and how to achieve their goals. 

## Usability Testing

After conducting a heuristic evaluation on it, I realized multiple principles were being violated especially: help and documentation, user control and freedom, and flexibility and efficiency of use. Hence I decided to look further into this website and see how my target audience reacts when using it to perform simple tasks. I started by a pilot Usability Test and focused on 3 main tasks:playing a workout video,finding the FAQ, using the favoring video function.

My goal with this experiment was to see if my Usability Test material was effective and in term better understand the usability experience of target users to then utilise those finding on my website.

### Overall Findings

This pilot usability testing aided me to fully understand the point of view of my target audience as well as validate some of my previous assumptions I made after the heuristic evaluation.
*  I saw that the participant had no issues with finding a workout video and playing it but she did struggle with ***finding the FAQ and the favorite video folder.*** 
* The participant did find the website overall ***easy to use and doesn’t require technical support*** to make it work but ***can be better integrated.***
I think that overall the pilot test went well and will be able to be counted in my data later on. From it, I realized how much when creating a website for fitness, I need to not only needed to focus on creating an efficient user experience to access the workout videos but also a great experience for other other on it such as finding the FAQ, login in, favoring a video etc.

## User Research - Contextual Inquiry

After conducting UT, I decide to expand pass competitors website and see how users look for fitness classes through the internet in general. I wanted to know how they started their research, what keywords they used and and what ultimately made them decided to go for a certain workout type/class. To do, so I set up a **participatory observation** where I asked the users questions about how they looked for workout classes online, and then watch then choose a class through online research and perform said workout. At the end, I asked them whether or not they were satisfied with the workout and the process in general. I told them not to go for website they usually go for straight away (as they have them saved) but start fresh looking on the internet.

### Overall Findings 

Overall the interview went well. The user did feel very frustrated when doing the tasks and left dissatified. In a way that proves the need for a project like mine that allows to streamline the search process and make the experience efficent and stress-free for the use.
Because of the nature of our conversation, some of the questions felt redudant to ask almost. I would say that next time, I would  need to be a bit more prepared as a moderator to adapt and not just stick to the script to avoid redudancies and create a sort of dialogue with the participant. 

#### Important things to note
I learn a lot of valuable information through this contextual inquiry. Here are some of the major insights gathered from the data:
* **Experience is overwhelming and takes too long** 
* **Friends opinion & social aspect of working out matter a lot.** 
* **Too much information online/lack of filters makes the research frustrating at times.** 
* **Price matters.** 
* **Users look at pictures of the workout as a way to guage what the workout will be like.** 

## UX Storytelling - User Personas & Scenarios

UX Storytelling reminds the researchers and designers that the experience must be user-centered. By think no longer websites based on heuristic principles and user interviews as data points, UX storytelling allows researcher to reflect on the underlying feeling and desires that users may have when completing the task and assuring that those are being satisfied by the results of the project. By creating personas, I will be able to think as the target users more generally and understand better how the current system in place does not meet their goals.

During my research, I created 3 personas: **June - the recent retiree  :family_woman_girl_boy:   , Mary - the social butterfly :butterfly:   & Evalyn - the busy bee  :honeybee:  .**

I identified their needs, challenges and goals as well as created an empathy map to better understand how they felt during the process. 
I then used this new found understanding of my audience to create scenarios about how my key design features would help them solve any frustration they may have had during that process.
