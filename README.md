## About this Project
This quarter's goal is to create a UX project that promotes well-being for middle age women. As we age, it is crucial to continue physical exercise on a daily basis to keep muscle mass and boost immune system and with the pandemic and people staying at home, it has been hard to be as active and work out. Being active is an essential part to well-being. It can often times be a pleasureful experience that helps feel happier overall and more concentrated and energetic.

However, online exercises classes are often either tailored to young adults and very fit individuals or on the opposite end of the spectrum elderly people and middle-age women sometimes feel left out of the equation. They are far more active and dynamic than elderly people but can also feel intimidated by intensive HIIT training targeted at a younger audience. Hence, my project would focus on a user-centric platform for fitness and well-being targeted at middle-age women. This platform will be easy to use and allow users to find all the fitnesses courses out there and see which ones are the best for them depending on variables such as time committment, prices, in-person or vitual, at home equipement or gym equipement, level of intensity etc. It will also create a community for my audience around the topics of fitness and well-being

## Community Contribution through this UX design

Through my UX design project, I hope to impact the lives of mid-age women (and potentially others) by offering an easy and seamless experience for people to find fitness programs/classes/exercises that fit into their schedule and help them stay in good health both physically and mentally. I also hope to incorporate a social aspect to this app to create a community around the topic of fitness habits. 

## Competitive Analysis & Heuristic Evaluation

The first step of the project was to look at websites focused on the same subject as this project,fitness, and see how they pass the Nielson's 10 Heuristic evaluation. Because of my topic and my audience, I choose to evaluate the website of the YMCA for online exercise classes, [YMCA 360](https://ymca360.org/on-demand), that sources videos from their gyms across the country and tries to meet the needs of all age groups. I also choose the app, [Yoga For Beginners](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/yoga-for-beginners-mind-body/id1382141225), that offers free yoga courses as well as detailed explanations of each pose.
