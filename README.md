## About this Project
This quarter's goal is to create a UX project that promotes well-being for middle age women. As we age, it is crucial to continue physical exercise on a daily basis to keep muscle mass and boost immune system and with the pandemic and people staying at home, it has been hard to be as active and work out. Being active is an essential part to well-being. It can often times be a pleasureful experience that helps feel happier overall and more concentrated and energetic.

However, online exercises classes are often either tailored to young adults and very fit individuals or on the opposite end of the spectrum elderly people and middle-age women sometimes feel left out of the equation. They are far more active and dynamic than elderly people but can also feel intimidated by intensive HIIT training targeted at a younger audience. Hence, my project would focus on a user-centric platform for fitness and well-being targeted at middle-age women. This platform will be easy to use and allow users to find all the fitnesses courses out there and see which ones are the best for them depending on variables such as time committment, prices, in-person or vitual, at home equipement or gym equipement, level of intensity etc. It will also create a community for my audience around the topics of fitness and well-being

## Community Contribution through this UX design

Through my UX design project, I hope to impact the lives of mid-age women (and potentially others) by offering an easy and seamless experience for people to find fitness programs/classes/exercises that fit into their schedule and help them stay in good health both physically and mentally. I also hope to incorporate a social aspect to this app to create a community around the topic of fitness habits. 

## Competitive Analysis & Heuristic Evaluation

The first step of the project was to look at websites focused on the same subject as this project,fitness, and see how they pass the Nielson's 10 Heuristic evaluation. Because of my topic and my audience, I choose to evaluate the website of the YMCA for online exercise classes, [YMCA 360](https://ymca360.org/on-demand), that sources videos from their gyms across the country and tries to meet the needs of all age groups. I also choose the app, [Yoga For Beginners](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/yoga-for-beginners-mind-body/id1382141225), that offers free yoga courses as well as detailed explanations of each pose.

### Overall Findings

Overall, both the YMCA 360 and Yoga for Beginners are well design with a minimalistic theme and very enticing high resolution photos. Both are easy and intuitive to navigate through, making users instantly feel in control. However, both still have some serious heuristic violations that make part of the user experience confusing and uncomfortable which could potentially discourage them from reusing the site on a daily basis or even giving them an easy way out of working out. As the goal of my project is to promote healthy fitness habits from middle-age women by making it easy and enticing to them, I have marked a couple point that truly stood out during this evaluation:
* It is important not to use fitness jargon. Instead, to meet the criteria of heuristic principle 2, ***Match between system and real world***, titles and descriptions of workouts should focus more on the benefits they bring and how they may fulfill the needs the user may feel they have when it comes to working out (legs strengthen, destress, cardio, arm workout etc)
* Secondly the user needs to be in control, heuristic principle 3, ***User Control and freedom***. Especially during the workout, the user must be able to pause, play, rewind, slow down the video all while being able to leave easily. This will allow the user to not feel pressure to get the movement right on the spot or to not take any breaks. It is important that everyone be able to go at their own rhythm so they can have fun.
* Finally, it is crucial to have proper documentation and , heuristic principle 10 - ***Help and documentation***, contact forms to get feedback. Especially with first time or less tech-savvy users, it is crucial to have a clear help guide accessible from all pages to help them truly understand how the platform works and how to achieve their goals. 

## Usability Testing

After conducting a heuristic evaluation on it, I realized multiple principles were being violated especially: help and documentation, user control and freedom, and flexibility and efficiency of use. Hence I decided to look further into this website and see how my target audience reacts when using it to perform simple tasks. I started by a pilot Usability Test and focused on 3 main tasks:playing a workout video,finding the FAQ, using the favoring video function.

My goal with this experiment was to see if my Usability Test material was effective and in term better understand the usability experience of target users to then utilise those finding on my website.

### Overall Findings

This pilot usability testing aided me to fully understand the point of view of my target audience as well as validate some of my previous assumptions I made after the heuristic evaluation.
*  I saw that the participant had no issues with finding a workout video and playing it but she did struggle with ***finding the FAQ and the favorite video folder.*** 
* The participant did find the website overall ***easy to use and doesn’t require technical support*** to make it work but ***can be better integrated.***
I think that overall the pilot test went well and will be able to be counted in my data later on. From it, I realized how much when creating a website for fitness, I need to not only needed to focus on creating an efficient user experience to access the workout videos but also a great experience for other other on it such as finding the FAQ, login in, favoring a video etc.

## User Research - Contextual Inquiry

### Step 6 - Relection

Overall the interview went well. The user did feel very frustrated when doing the tasks and left dissatified. In a way that proves the need for a project like mine that allows to streamline the search process and make the experience efficent and stress-free for the use.
Because of the nature of our conversation, some of the questions felt redudant to ask almost. I would say that next time, I would  need to be a bit more prepared as a moderator to adapt and not just stick to the script to avoid redudancies and create a sort of dialogue with the participant. 

#### Important things to note
I learn a lot of valuable information through this contextual inquiry. Here are some of the major insights gathered from the data:
* **Experience is overwhelming and takes too long:** The overarching theme of this research is that the current opions in place to find fitness classes through the internet is long and overwhelling. There are too many choices and you need to put in the right strings of words to get anywhere close to what you want (i.e the participant types "arms classes" and landed on a gun website). Additionally, even if you find the right words to type-in you then have so many choices and you need to go through several sites before finding one that works for you based on the length of the video, who is the target audience, the price etc. Hence, this interview really showed the importance of my project.
* **Friends opinion matter:** A great way to streamline the process is to ask friends their recommendations and start from there. While the participant did not use social media to find workout classes, the social aspect of working out was extremely important to her. She valued her friends opinions about workout and felt more happy doing workout with her friends. This insight helped me realize the importance of including a social aspect to my project to help people find workout more easily and possibly also entice them to workout more. 
* **Too much information online/lack of filters:** One of the biggest problems with search process was the amount of choice and ability to filter through them. Hence, filtering based on target demographic, price, equipement, lenght, type of exerices, etc. will be extremely important. Maybe I will have to do an card sorting exerices to help me understand how to present features on the website. 
* **Price matters:** Knowing if something was free or not was crutial for the participant especially if the class was online and she did it alone at home. However, she did pay for a YMCA membership before the pandemic. Hence, it is important to present the price for each workout and also what type it is. 
* **Pictures are important:** The most interesting piece of data was how much the participant looked at the picture before each video she choose. For her, that picture and the lenght was all the information she needed about the workout before playing it. In the picture she looked at what age, what gender, and what type of equipement the instructor was using. It was incredibly important to her that the instructor had the same age and gender as her as it meant it was made for people like her. Having high quality images that show what the workout will be like will therefore be essential for my project.
