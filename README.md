## Project topic 
This quarter's goal is to create a UX product that promotes well-being for middle age women. As we age, it is crucial to continue physical exercise on a daily basis to keep muscle mass and boost immune system and with the pandemic and people staying at home, it has been hard to be as active and work out. Additionally, online exercises classes are often either tailored to young adults and very fit individuals or on the opposite end of the spectrum elderly people. However, middle age women are usually stuck in between. They are far more active than elderly people but sometimes don't feel like they can handle anymore intensive HIIT training targeted at a younger audience. This is why I decided that my project would focus on fitness and being a platform where you can find all the course out them and see which ones are the best for you depending on variables such as time committment, prices, in-person or vitual, with at home equipement or gym equipement, level of intensity etc. 

While my project is not set in stone the fitness topic is as I believe that being active is an essential part to well-being. It can often times be a pleasureful experience that helps feel happier overall and more concentrated and energetic.
