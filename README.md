## About this Project
This quarter's goal is to create a UX project that promotes well-being for middle age women. As we age, it is crucial to continue physical exercise on a daily basis to keep muscle mass and boost immune system and with the pandemic and people staying at home, it has been hard to be as active and work out. Being active is an essential part to well-being. It can often times be a pleasureful experience that helps feel happier overall and more concentrated and energetic.

However, online exercises classes are often either tailored to young adults and very fit individuals or on the opposite end of the spectrum elderly people and middle-age women sometimes feel left out of the equation. They are far more active and dynamic than elderly people but can also feel intimidated by intensive HIIT training targeted at a younger audience. Hence, my project would focus on a user-centric platform for fitness and well-being targeted at middle-age women. This platform will be easy to use and allow users to find all the fitnesses courses out there and see which ones are the best for them depending on variables such as time committment, prices, in-person or vitual, at home equipement or gym equipement, level of intensity etc. It will also create a community for my audience around the topics of fitness and well-being

## Community Contribution through this UX design

Through my UX design project, I hope to impact the lives of mid-age women (and potentially others) by offering an easy and seamless experience for people to find fitness programs/classes/exercises that fit into their schedule and help them stay in good health both physically and mentally. I also hope to incorporate a social aspect to this app to create a community around the topic of fitness habits. 

## Competitive Analysis & Heuristic Evaluation

The first step of the project was to look at websites focused on the same subject as this project,fitness, and see how they pass the Nielson's 10 Heuristic evaluation. Because of my topic and my audience, I choose to evaluate the website of the YMCA for online exercise classes, [YMCA 360](https://ymca360.org/on-demand), that sources videos from their gyms across the country and tries to meet the needs of all age groups. I also choose the app, [Yoga For Beginners](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/yoga-for-beginners-mind-body/id1382141225), that offers free yoga courses as well as detailed explanations of each pose.

### Overall Findings

Overall, both the YMCA 360 and Yoga for Beginners are well design with a minimalistic theme and very enticing high resolution photos. Both are easy and intuitive to navigate through, making users instantly feel in control. However, both still have some serious heuristic violations that make part of the user experience confusing and uncomfortable which could potentially discourage them from reusing the site on a daily basis or even giving them an easy way out of working out. As the goal of my project is to promote healthy fitness habits from middle-age women by making it easy and enticing to them, I have marked a couple point that truly stood out during this evaluation:
* It is important not to use fitness jargon. Instead, to meet the criteria of heuristic principle 2, ***Match between system and real world***, titles and descriptions of workouts should focus more on the benefits they bring and how they may fulfill the needs the user may feel they have when it comes to working out (legs strengthen, destress, cardio, arm workout etc)
* Secondly the user needs to be in control, heuristic principle 3, ***User Control and freedom***. Especially during the workout, the user must be able to pause, play, rewind, slow down the video all while being able to leave easily. This will allow the user to not feel pressure to get the movement right on the spot or to not take any breaks. It is important that everyone be able to go at their own rhythm so they can have fun.
* Finally, it is crucial to have proper documentation and , heuristic principle 10 - ***Help and documentation***, contact forms to get feedback. Especially with first time or less tech-savvy users, it is crucial to have a clear help guide accessible from all pages to help them truly understand how the platform works and how to achieve their goals.
