## Contextual Inquiry

### Step 1 - Specify the main design challenge 

#### What is the main activity your project would support the usersâ€™ needs?
> The main activity my project supports is the ability for users to find videos across the internet that meet their fitness needs based on various criterias. Hence the platform would help users look for workout video, courses and challenges that could work into their daily routine easily and make them excited to workout. While my platform helps with fitness overall the main part of the working out activity it does is to help the users find such exercise. 

#### What is the basic need involved for that activity?
> This activity requires currently a computer/tablet/mobile. While in non-Covid times, users could also walk around the neighboorhood and inquire about local workout classes with covid most gyms are close and often registration for outdoors social-distanced classes are done online, hence users will always need some electronic device to find these classes and that is where my project come in to play. As for sport equipement, it depends. My project allow users to filter by equipement they have or not so a part from a electronic device with a search browser and some sport clothes the user needs nothing else. 

#### What is(are) the traditional/current solution(s) to satisfy the needs?
> Pre-COVID, users could either look up online or check out local gyms and other fitness center in-person and inquire about their equipement and potential classes. Now with COVID, most gyms are closed or require online reservations to come in, hence, most of the solutions are online.  

#### What is(are) the limitation(s) that possibly would be improved with (digital) technology?
> Through the internet, they need to search through thousands of websites/blogs/youtube videos etc. to find something that they are looking for and the web browsers are not created to allow for easy filtering of all those sites. That is where my projects comes into play. It facilitates finding classes and simplifies current solutions.

### Step 2 - Target users 

#### What are the characteristics of users? (ex. demographics, preference, expertise) 
> My users can be anyone though I created this website with the idea of helping middle-age women find online classes. These women tend to be less use to finding workouts online as they did not grow up with the internet. Before Covid, they were most likely exercising at their local gym. They can have any level of expertise in fitness though I target more novice ones as they might be the most lost in what is a great exercise routine for themselves compared to more experienced. They will have different types of preferences (yoga/core/running,with equipement/without equipement, etc). 

#### Where would the users do that activity? (i.e., context of use)
> These users will mostly be doing these activites at home due to covid, through some could be exercises to do with equipement at the gym and then for places where group classes have opened up, it will also showcase all the classes available in the area. So they will use this project to choose what kind of workout to do and even create a weekly schedule for themselves. 

#### What would the users do to complete that activity? (e.g., goal, operation, method, action)
> They would likely want to find a workout class that fit their needs. To do so, they would go online and search for what they want. If need be, they might also have to pay to access those classes or register in advance to be part of a class. 

### Step 3 - Pick observation method(s)
I decided to pick **participatory observation** as a mean of observation methode as I thought it would be the most useful for me and the safest. I decide to take person that fit my demographic criterias (my mother) and my living room as a space as she usually works out there and by living together, I was avoiding taking risk of seeing other people during these times. I was interested in seeing how my user performs these actions in depth, in the comfort of their own home. This recreated the context they would usually perform these tasks.
I thought it made sense to pick such methods as currently most people are not able to exercise at the gym or in groups so the only way is often by doing cardio such as running or by watching online videos. 
I will however force my user to not just stick to their typical workout but actually find a new one as I want to understand the process of finding a workout that fits their needs rather than just how they go back to the ones they already like. 

### Step 4 & 5 - Setting-up + Interview

#### Planning 
> I plan to do the interview at my hose when the user is planning on working out. I will observe them choosing a workout online and ask them about their choise and then observe how they interact with the workout while doing it. I plan to collect the data from it with an audio interview as well as written notes I will take (including when they are working out). I did not post a video interview as the the interviewe did not feel comfortable being filmed while working out. 

#### Contextual Interview Material
*Because the interviewe did not feel comfortable being filmed while working out, I will only post the audio of the workout and the transcript.*

* Please find my contextual inquiry guide script [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1k-YUpLMlWf4HpT_52NV4pB9DiD5obErS7qDabP8DCug/edit?usp=sharing)
* Please find the audio of the interview [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1kgUQlv33uadG6k9_0LzbzBOTQQ4cVwif/view?usp=sharing)
* Please find the transcript of the interview [here](audio_contextual_otter.ai.txt)
* Please find interview notes [here](notes_from_contextual.pdf)

### Step 6 - Relection

Overall the interview went well. The user did feel very frustrated when doing the tasks and left dissatified. In a way that proves the need for a project like mine that allows to streamline the search process and make the experience efficent and stress-free for the use.
Because of the nature of our conversation, some of the questions felt redudant to ask almost. I would say that next time, I would  need to be a bit more prepared as a moderator to adapt and not just stick to the script to avoid redudancies and create a sort of dialogue with the participant. 

#### Important things to note
I learn a lot of valuable information through this contextual inquiry. Here are some of the major insights gathered from the data:
* **Experience is overwhelming and takes too long:** The overarching theme of this research is that the current opions in place to find fitness classes through the internet is long and overwhelling. There are too many choices and you need to put in the right strings of words to get anywhere close to what you want (i.e the participant types "arms classes" and landed on a gun website). Additionally, even if you find the right words to type-in you then have so many choices and you need to go through several sites before finding one that works for you based on the length of the video, who is the target audience, the price etc. Hence, this interview really showed the importance of my project.
* **Friends opinion matter:** A great way to streamline the process is to ask friends their recommendations and start from there. While the participant did not use social media to find workout classes, the social aspect of working out was extremely important to her. She valued her friends opinions about workout and felt more happy doing workout with her friends. This insight helped me realize the importance of including a social aspect to my project to help people find workout more easily and possibly also entice them to workout more. 
* **Too much information online/lack of filters:** One of the biggest problems with search process was the amount of choice and ability to filter through them. Hence, filtering based on target demographic, price, equipement, lenght, type of exerices, etc. will be extremely important. Maybe I will have to do an card sorting exerices to help me understand how to present features on the website. 
* **Price matters:** Knowing if something was free or not was crutial for the participant especially if the class was online and she did it alone at home. However, she did pay for a YMCA membership before the pandemic. Hence, it is important to present the price for each workout and also what type it is. 
* **Pictures are important:** The most interesting piece of data was how much the participant looked at the picture before each video she choose. For her, that picture and the lenght was all the information she needed about the workout before playing it. In the picture she looked at what age, what gender, and what type of equipement the instructor was using. It was incredibly important to her that the instructor had the same age and gender as her as it meant it was made for people like her. Having high quality images that show what the workout will be like will therefore be essential for my project.
