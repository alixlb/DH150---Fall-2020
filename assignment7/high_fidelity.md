### Reflection

After having to unfortunately shift from AdobeXD to Figma, the rest of the assignment felt pretty fun. I enjoyed first coming up with color schemes and typography and then started building my frames based on my drawings. It took a while to understand certain features such as how to use overlays. I also added some great plug-ins to help me such as star maker, stories from freepik, phosphor ican and stark.
