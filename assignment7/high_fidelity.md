# High Fidelity Prototype
## Purpose of high-fidelity prototype
Many people have had a hard time transitioning from their gym classes to having to workout online at-home. This project sets out to create an website that facilitates working out and adapting your workout to our current way of life. 
This high-fidelity prototype is a great way to incorportate all the research I have done over the last 6 weeks into one final mockup. By building this prototype, I aim to get design a website and see what are the usability aspects (color contrast, heuristic principles,etc) that need to be improve. I also am trying to guage what is the most intuitive flow possible for my target audience.
While at first hesitating between Figma and Adobe XD, I ultimately decided to use Figma to create this prototype with the help of some plugins. 

### Tasks possible through this high-fidelity prototype
* filter options to find workout more easily
* view other people's reviews of the workout
* be able to chat with people in the classes you are registered for
* take a quiz to help you find what you need

## Graphical Design Interface - Decision making 


### 3 prototypes

### Accessebilty check 
Stark was the most interesting as it helped me see how people that were colorblind view my website. 

### Impression Test
After checking color contrast on all of them, I asked a person in my target demographic to look over all 3 prototype for 20 seconds each while saying out loud what they like and  dislike about each. I then asked them their favorite and any other feed back they may have.

Overall, the participant liked prototype 2 the best and prototype 3 the least. She didn't like the monogram look and feel of the prototype 3 nore its more funky font. She also noted that the buttons were way to small for her or anyone her age and that it might be best to enlarge them. Overall protype 2 was the winner even thought she also did like the font and image on protype 1. 

### Final Decision about Design 

## High Fidelity Prototype

### Screen Designs

### Wireframe

## Reflection

After having to unfortunately shift from AdobeXD to Figma, the rest of the assignment felt pretty fun. I enjoyed first coming up with color schemes and typography and then started building my frames based on my drawings. It took a while to understand certain features such as how to use overlays. I also added some great plug-ins to help me such as star maker, stories from freepik, phosphor ican and stark. 

### How to improve for next week

### What needs to be worked on 
* **Logo:** The logo does not truly reflect the website look and feel. While this current placeholder is necessary as it allows people to click back and go back to the home screen, it is not the best and I would like to change it for next week. 
* **Animations:** A lot of the more realistic part of the wireflow need to be added in to be a high-fidelity prototype. For example, currently on the home page, when you click on the search bar it brings you to the search page for "yoga" without anything being typed. In the final version, I'd like the keyword yoga to appear in the search bar before it leads you to the search page. However, due to the lack of time, and me focusing more on the look and feel as well as the essential framed being finished, this feature will have to wait till next week.
